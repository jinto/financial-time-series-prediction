# [STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning

*Work-in-Progress (Will begin at Oct 22. 2018)*

This is a repository for the [[STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning](https://studypie.co/course/machine-learning/price_predict/)

## Introduction
- Instructor: [Jongho Kim](https://jonghkim.github.io/), Quantitative Researcher at NICE Pricing and Information (quantic.jh@gmail.com)
- This sesseion DOES NOT aim to learn automatic trading systems, rather DOES concentrate on stock / coin price prediction based on deep learning, pursuing the most essential algorithms
- This sesseion is an intermediate level course for those who have basic knowledge (Python, Numpy, Pandas, pip) of Python and machine learning

## Goal of this study
- Understand the problems with financial time series predictions and advantages/disadvantages of machine learning 
- Learn how to implement FNN, CNN, RNN models using Tensorflow Keras API on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
- Learn how to implement time series prediction models with various metrics for robusteness of algorithms using Tensorflow Keras API 
- Learn how to implement your own neural network models with cryptocurrency data which includes bid/ask volumes, minute level prices and trading volumes 

## Modules
- This session is desinged with four modules:
    - Module 1. [Getting Started + Google Colab Setting](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module1)
    - Module 2. [Learning Tensorflow Keras API](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module2)
    - Module 3. [Implementing Time Series Prediciton Models](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module3)
    - Module 4. [Implementing Time Series Prediciton Models (More Comprehensive)](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module4)
