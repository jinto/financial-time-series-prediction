# [STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning

*Work-in-Progress (Will begin at Oct 22. 2018)*

This is a repository for the [[STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning](https://studypie.co/course/machine-learning/price_predict/)

### Introduction
- Instructor: [Jongho Kim](https://jonghkim.github.io/), Quantitative Researcher at NICE Pricing and Information (quantic.jh@gmail.com)
- This sesseion DOES NOT aim to learn automatic trading systems, rather DOES concentrate on stock / coin price prediction based on deep learning, pursuing the most essential algorithms
- This sesseion is an intermediate level course for those who have basic knowledge (Python, Numpy, Pandas, pip) of Python and machine learning

### Goal of this study
- Machine Learning in Finance
    - Machine Learning을 통해 Financial Time Series Prediction 문제를 해결할때 발생하는 이슈를 검토해 본다.
- Tensorflow Keras를 통한 Time Series Prediction 모델 구현
    - Tensorflow Keras API를 이용해 Time Series Prediction 모델을 실제 구현해본다.
- 다양한 Neural Networks 구조 구현
    - FNN, CNN, RNN등을 조합하여 본인만의 Neural Networks 구조를 실제 데이터에 적용해 본다.
- Google Colaboratory 사용법 학습
    - FNN, CNN, RNN등을 조합하여 본인만의 Neural Networks 구조를 실제 데이터에 적용해 본다.
