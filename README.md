# [STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning

*Work-in-Progress (Will begin at Oct 22. 2018)*

This is a repository for the [[STUDYPIE] Predicting Financial Time Series by using Deep Learning](https://studypie.co/course/machine-learning/price_predict/)

## Introduction
- Instructor: [Jongho Kim](https://jonghkim.github.io/), Quantitative Researcher at NICE Pricing and Information (quantic.jh@gmail.com)

- This sesseion DOES NOT aim to learn automatic trading systems, rather DOES concentrate on stock / coin price prediction based on deep learning, pursuing the most essential algorithms

- This sesseion is an intermediate level course for those who have basic knowledge (Python, Numpy, Pandas, pip) of Python and machine learning
    
- This session is desinged with four modules:
    1. Module1: (Lecture) Machine Learning in Finance
    2. Module2: (Hands-on-Labs) Tensorflow Keras with Google Colab
    3. Module3: (Hands-on-Labs) 
    4. Module4: (Hands-on-Labs)

### Module 1. [Getting Started + Google Colab Setting](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module1)

### Module 2. [Learning Tensorflow Keras API](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module2)

### Module 3. [Exercise - Implementing Time Series Prediciton Models](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module3)

### Module 4. [Exercise - Implementing Time Series Prediciton Models (More Comprehensive)](https://github.com/jonghkim/financial-time-series-prediction/tree/master/Module4)
